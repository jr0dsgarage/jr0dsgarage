- 👋 Hi, I’m Jarrod, but my friends call me j__r0d.  Welcome to @jr0dsgarage
- 👀 I’m interested in minecraft, Apple ][ 6502 assembly, and messing around with audio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and assembly for the 6502 processor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music maybe? need a redstone design?
